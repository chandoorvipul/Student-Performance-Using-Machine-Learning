# Student Performance Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
### Data Set â€“ Student Performance 
(https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
* Data set consist of 8 columns and 1000 rows.  Columns are gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, math score, reading score, writing score. 
* Initial goals of this project are to clean the data, scatterplot of the cleaned data, Train 25% of data, test 75% of data, finding the relation between the parental level of education and score on each subject, test preparation course vs gender. These are the initial goals of the project. 
* Learned how to use all diffrent modules, explored python and spyder, got to know what type of graphs can be used based on data.
