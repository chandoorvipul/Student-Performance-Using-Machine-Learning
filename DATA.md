# Data 
* First thing to do after getting the data set is explore the data set and should know what all we have. Find the link for data manipulation which output is cleaned data. 
 We will use .info() to look into the dataset. 
* In this data set we will create a feature i.e. average of all three marks from the data set they are math score, reading score, Writing score. 
* Then we will split the data frame by using Using train_test_split(). train and test the data set by 75% and 25%.
* We take 'math score','reading score', 'writing score' as X and Average as Y. 
* Then we We will the reg value for the above X and y 
* we are also finding Mean Squared error and The root mean squared error.
